## install and recover

* [D-Link Recovery GUI](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/installation_methods/d-link_recovery_gui) is on http://192.168.0.101 for dir-645 (normally http://192.168.0.1)
  + seems _not_ to work with my device

## Usage

* I use the device in bridged mode for several years now. Used LAN4 as bridged eth port.
  + In this mode, the device is invisible.
  + On WAN eth port, device is configured to use 192.168.10.10/24 (from fixed DHCP)
  + WAN connection is only available is LAN is _not_ plugged.
* Before that, I used the device in route mode with 192.168.10.10/24 (static) on WAN, and 192.168.11.11 (static) on LAN.
  + In this mode, LUCI web UI is only accessible on the LAN side.
* The device also has a hard reset button on button side (you need a pen). This is _not_ the reset button mentioned in openwrt documentation.
