# proxy-wasm

* [overview and motivation](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec/blob/master/docs/WebAssembly-in-Envoy.md) featured!

## spec

* [WebAssembly for Proxies](https://github.com/proxy-wasm/spec) links to implementations and server featured!
* [go implementation](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk)
  + [technical overview](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk/blob/main/doc/OVERVIEW.md) featured!
  + based on [tinygo](https://tinygo.org/)
  + gc problems, better with [nottinygc](https://github.com/wasilibs/nottinygc)
* [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html) toolchain for C/C++

## use

* [usage in getenroute](https://www.getenroute.io/blog/developer-program-ingress-wasm-validate-verify-transform) with examples
* [usage in kong](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/wasm/filter-configuration/)

### json validation

* [JSON schema validators implementations](https://json-schema.org/implementations)
* [wasm example](https://github.com/chiefbiiko/json-schm-wasm) typescript, rust
* [tinyjson](https://github.com/CosmWasm/tinyjson) golang, developed for CosmWasm
* [example from go sdk](https://github.com/tetratelabs/proxy-wasm-go-sdk/tree/main/examples/json_validation)

### openapi validation

* [kin-openapi](https://github.com/getkin/kin-openapi) validation http request to openapi (not WASM, however)
